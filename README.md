# social_media

this repo is a total mess, it was my very first project and I had a really hard time 
putting all these together with help only from youtube tutorials 
and blog posts. Back then I only heard of solid principles but but did not properly understand
how to put them to practice in my code. I always thought I will come back to this and change it,
but now it seems easier to start other projects from scratch than to get lost in this one.
